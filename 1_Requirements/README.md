# Description
* The number system conversion project is developed using C Programming. Few most common bases are decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal. This system converts a decimal number to the number of another base. Since digital logic operation requires a lot of calculations, this system makes the task easier.
Conversions can be carried out in a single step or in a multistep manner. Below are the conversions of numbersystem offered.
* Decimal to binary
* Decimal to Octal
* Decimal to hexadecimal
* Binary to octal
* Binary to hexadecial
* Binary to decimal
* Hexadecimal to decimal
* Hexadecimal to Binary
* Octal to Binary
* Octal to Decimal

 # Research
 Binary Number System
The binary number system contains two unique numerals (0 and 1). This system is thus a base 2 number system. The relative magnitudes of the symbols are 0 < 1.  The symbols in this system are often referred to as binary digits or just bits.
 Octal Number System
The octal number system contains 8 unique numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). This system is thus a base 8 number system. The relative magnitudes of the symbols are 0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7.
 Hexadecimal Number System
The hexadecimal number system contains 16 unique numerals.  Since there are only 10 Arabic numerals in the decimal system, we need to use other symbols to represent the remaining 6 numerals. We use the alphabetic
characters Aâ€“F in order to expand the system to 16 numerals. The 16 numerals in the hexadecimal system are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. The relative magnitudes of the symbols are
0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < A < B < C < D < E < F.

## High Level Requirements
* User must have Knowledge of number system.
* Display the output without error

## Low Level Requirements
* User must be able to read the output.
* Selection of choice.


## SWOT
### Strengths:
* Easy conversions can be done
* Tidious mathematical calculations are not required
* Easy to use

### Weakness:
* Negetive numbers are not considered

### Opportunities:
* Enlargement of the system by adding other conversions like BCD, XS-3 etc
* Considering the negetive numbers 

### Threat:
* Emphasis on limited schemes.
