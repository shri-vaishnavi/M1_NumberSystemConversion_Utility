# Description
* The number system conversion project is developed using C Programming. Few most common bases are decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal. This system converts a decimal number to the number of another base. Since digital logic operation requires a lot of calculations, this system makes the task easier.

## High Level Requirements
* User must have Knowledge of number system.
* Display the output without error

## Low Level Requirements
* User must be able to read the output.
* Selection of choice.


## SWOT
# Strengths:
* Easy conversions can be done
* Tidious mathematical calculations are not required
* Easy to use

* Weakness:
** Garbage value is returned if the size of input exceeds

## 4W's & 1H
# WHO
* Students from Electronics domain
* Digital circutry designer

# What
* Convert the number from one base to another with the help of this project in timely manner.

# When
* At the initial stage of digital circuit designing operation.

# Where
* At colleges for the verification of mannual calculations for the students.

# How
* Performs  calculations and make user's task smooth and effortless. 
* It will also work with Windows and Linux.
